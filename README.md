# ScriptHookVDotNet-nightly
Mirror for CI builds.

Nightly gets an update once a day, building starts at 10:00 UTC, usually builds are available five minutes later.
We will have no nightly if there are new commits added since the latest nightly release.

For commit history, see https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/commits/main.
