# ScriptHookVDotNet-nightly
Mirror for CI builds.

Nightly gets an update for a release every commit pushed on [the main repository](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/commits/main).
Commit SHAs on tags are not important for artifacts on this nightly repository, as they only reference commits on this nightly repository, which is rarely updated by commits.

For the commit history on the main repository, see https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/commits/main.
